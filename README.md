# Oracle-tips
Oracle tips and tools that make my life easier

My first Github REPO.  I often come across questions that I'm not able to find direct answers to.  When that happens, I spend some time digging and pulling pieces together from various sources.
Feel free to look around and make suggestions.

Since it's my first Repo, I have no experience at managing pull requests, so if you have suggestions and input you'd like to submit, please be patient as I try to figure this out as I go along.
